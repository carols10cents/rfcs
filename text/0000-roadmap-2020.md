# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Lays out the Rust roadmap for 2020. The roadmap takes the form of the
following goals for the project:

* Prepare for a possible Rust 2021 Edition
* Follow-up on in-progress designs and efforts
* Improve project functioning, governance, and visibility

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Every year, the Rust project plans out a roadmap, in accordance with
[RFC 1728]. The goal of the roadmap is to help the Rust teams focus
their efforts to ensure that we are addressing the most prominent
problems. To that end, the roadmap describes the general goals that we
believe the teams ought to be pursuing. These goals were chosen based
on a number of sources:

[RFC 1728]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1728-north-star.html

* Preliminary analysis of the [2019 survey], which took place in
  December.
* The [many #rust2020 blog posts][rust2020] written in response to our
  [call for blog posts].
* The thoughts and inputs from the members of the various Rust teams.

[2019 survey]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/12/03/survey-launch.html

[call for blog posts]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/29/A-call-for-blogs-2020.html

The roadmap is not meant to be "exclusive" -- that is, it's not the
case that every single thing we do must tie in some way to the
roadmap. But we do expect that our largest efforts will be put towards
addressing the roadmap goals.

## Structure of the roadmap

The roadmap this year is based around a few central themes. These goals
are intentionally rather broad -- they are meant to be interpreted
throughout the year by the various teams, as they make decisions about
what to pursue.

The roadmap does not contain specific technical details or
proposals. We encourage the individual teams to post their thoughts
about goals and ongoing projects for 2020, either in the form of
Inside Rust blog posts or as internals threads.

# The goals

The list of goals for Rust in 2020 are:

* Prepare for a Rust 2021 Edition
* Followthrough with in-progress designs and efforts
* Improve project functioning, governance, and visibility

## Prepare for a Rust 2021 edition

One of our goals for this year should be plan out any changes that we
wish to make as part of the next Rust edition. If we are to continue
the three-year cadence established with the release of Rust 2018, then
the next edition would be released in 2021.

One thing that we learned quite clearly from the experience of Rust
2018 was the importance of preparation. If we wish to do a Rust 2021
edition, we need to be planning for it now. **The goal should be that
any changes we wish to make in Rust 2021 are completed by October of
2020**. Completed here means that the changes are available on
Nightly.

We've got a number of "in progress" language design errors that may
require minor changes tied to an edition, but this list is by no means
exhaustive:

* Error handling, which could potentially see the introduction of new syntactic
  forms;
* Improvements to the trait system;
* Improvements to unsafe code, which might involve introducing new syntax like
  the `&raw` form proposed in [RFC 2582].

[RFC 2582]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2582-raw-reference-mir-operator.html
[#57893]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893

One goal for this year, then, is to flesh out those areas in more detail and
decide what changes, if any, we would like to do for Rust 2021. It is key to
identify and plan out the changes we want to make sufficiently early that the
tooling and documentation around these changes has time to mature before
shipping.

Note that, as ever, any edition-related change would require appropriate tooling
to help people transition their code. Furthermore, the compiler would continue
to support older editions, ensuring that Rust's stability promise is maintained.

When the October 2020 deadline arrives, we may find that we have no
changes planned that require an edition. We expect that by the end of
October, we will have an RFC up (and ideally merged) indicating
whether a 2021 edition will occur and describing the work to be done.

## Followthrough with in-progress designs and efforts

A major theme highlighted in numerous blog posts and team member's feedback is
our current long queues, and indeed tendency for "unbounded queues." This often
leads to RFCs which are accepted and have remained unimplemented for years,
making it unclear what their current state is. Often, the rationale laid out by
the RFC is either no longer true, or at least lacks modern context.

Over the past several years, we have experimented with several concepts: working
groups as part of the 2018 edition (specifically, domain working groups) and
project groups (inline assembly, safe transmute). The language team has also
explored the use of shepherds to guide RFCs. The compiler team has a wide area
of subgroups targeting a specific initiative (such as self-profile, or rls-2.0).

It is unclear to many which of these efforts is still ongoing and which naming
conventions to use; one of the goals for 2020 is to clarify the scope of these
groups and lay the groundwork for future iteration. We should reflect on the
success and failures of past attempts, and work to ensure that going forward we
use the more successful strategies.

We also intend to set a high level goal of flushing our queues. We should work
to reduce the backlog of accepted RFCs and in progress ideas, whether by
explicitly rejecting or implementing them. This does not mean that we should not
accept new work -- but we should have a high level goal in mind of finishing the
year with less, rather than more, "planned" work.

## Improve project functioning, governance, and visibility

> Organizational work is at the core of everything else that happens in the project, and above all else this seems to be the one thing we should keep improving. Weâ€™re growing fast, and our organization needs to grow with it.

The Rust project has grown dramatically over the last few years, in every dimension:

* We have more users than ever before.
* We are seeing many more companies -- and much larger companies -- adopting Rust.
* Our organization and Rust teams have grown.

This is great news! But with this growth comes challenges. Some of the
specific things that we would like to address:

* **It can be quite difficult to get visibility into "what is going
  on".** It should be easier to answer questions like "what are the
  active efforts and how can I help" to "what is the status of feature
  X".
* **It is often difficult to find enough people to do the work that
  seems to be needed.** Perhaps the most obvious solution to this is
  to try and get more people paid for their work on Rust, but we also
  wish to encourage and better facilitate volunteer contribution.
  * Further, our system is particularly susceptible to work "falling
    off" in the middle, as discussed in the previous section. It is
    difficult to sustain focus and get complete follow-through.
* **Design discussions, particularly controversial ones, can be
  exhausting and impossible to keep up with.** Further, cross-cutting
  projects that cut across multiple teams can be particularly
  difficult to manage.

Therefore, we believe that we should make a point this year to focus
on improving our organization itself.

# Yearly calendar

Here is a rough calendar of major events in the planning of Rust. Note
that we have attempted to move up some of the Rust 2022 planning --
e.g., the survey, edition, and so forth -- so that they begin earlier
in 2021, versus the timing from this year.

* January
  * Rust 2020 survey results published
  * Roadmap RFC opened
* February 
* March
  * Rust All Hands will take place March 16-20
* April
* May 
* June
* July
* August
* September
  * Start the Rust survey
* October:
  * Publish survey results
  * All 2021 edition work must be landed
  * Call for Rust 2022 blog posts begins here
* November -- 
* December -- holiday month, things traditionally run slowly here

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

One concern that has come up this year in particular is that we frequently do
not "tie" efforts actively to goals established in past roadmaps. This is one
reason that this year's roadmap is specifically intended to be much more high
level, with the fine grained details left up to the individual teams and the
community to decide upon.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

The roadmap this year is different in structure than prior years.  In
particular, we have avoided setting precise technical goals, in favor
of more general mandates and themes.

We chose to take this approach for a few reasons:

* The roadmap RFC doesn't seem like an appropriate place to make
  decisions on specific solutions. Those should be discussed in their own,
  dedicated RFCs.
* We wanted to encourage teams and project members to think about how theseq
  mandates apply best to the particular questions that they are working with.
