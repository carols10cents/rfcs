# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Lays out the Rust roadmap for 2020. The roadmap takes the form of the
following goals for the project:

* Prepare for a possible Rust 2021 Edition
* Follow-up on in-progress designs and efforts
* Improve project functioning, governance, and visibility

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Every year, the Rust project plans out a roadmap. The process was
kicked off in [RFC 1728], although the shape of roadmaps has changed
from year to year.

[RFC 1728]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1728-north-star.html

The goal of the roadmap is to help the Rust community focus its
efforts to ensure that we are addressing the most prominent problems.
The roadmap is based on a number of sources:

* Preliminary analysis of the [2019 survey], which took place in
  December.
* The [many #rust2020 blog posts][rust2020] written in response to our
  [call for blog posts].
* The thoughts and inputs from the members of the various Rust teams.

## Structure of the roadmap

The roadmap this year is based around a few central goals. These goals
are intentionally rather broad -- they are meant to be interpreted
throughout the year by the various teams, as they make decisions about
what to pursue.

We also encourage individual teams to post their thoughts about goals
and ongoing projects for 2020, either in the form of Inside Rust blog
posts or as internals threads.

In addition to the key goals, the roadmap also identifies some themes

# The goals

The list of goals for Rust in 2020 are:

* Prepare for a possible Rust 2021 Edition
* Follow-up on in-progress designs and efforts
* Improve project functioning, governance, and visibility

## Prepare for a Rust 2021 edition

One of our goals for this year should be plan out any changes that we
wish to make as part of the next Rust edition. If we are to continue
the three-year cadence established with the release of Rust 2018, then
the next edition would be released in 2021.

One thing that we learned quite clearly from the experience of Rust
2018 was the importance of preparation. If we wish to do a Rust 2021
edition, we need to be planning for it now. **The goal should be that
any changes we wish to make in Rust 2021 are completed by October of
2020**. Completed here means that the changes are available on
Nightly.

There are a number of "focus areas" in this RFC that could potentially
involve edition-related changes:

* Error handling, which could potentially see the introduction of new syntactic forms;
* Improvements to the trait system, including a [proposed soundness fix](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893#issuecomment-546972824) for [#57893];
* Improvements to unsafe code, which might involve introducing new syntax like the `&raw` form proposed in [RFC 2582].

[RFC 2582]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2582-raw-reference-mir-operator.html
[#57893]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893

One goal for this year, then, is to flesh out those areas in more detail and decide what changes, if any, we would like to do for Rust 2021. 

Note that, as ever, any edition-related change would require appropriate tooling to help people transition their code. Furthermore, the compiler would continue to support older editions, ensuring that Rust's stability promise is maintained.

When the October 2020 deadline arrives, we may find that we have no changes planned that require an edition. In this case, we can re-evaluate whether we should do a Rust 2021 edition or not.



# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, cargo, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that rust sometimes intentionally diverges from common language features.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project and language in your proposal.
Also consider how the this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
